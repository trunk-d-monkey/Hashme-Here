Hashme HERE and Hashit

Files: hashme.py, hashme.bat, hashit.py, hashit.bat

============ INSTRUCTIONS ==============================================
========================================================================
This uses Python's native hash library to hash the files in the folder
it is started from and all files in subfolders recursively.  It will 
store the hashes in a TSV file in the folder it is run in that can be
opened and the hashes copied and pasted elsewhere.  It will remove the 
full path so you only have the file names and subfolder paths.  

INSTRUCTIONS:
Make a folder and add it to your system path (suggested "C:\Scripts"
where you can add additional scripts OR if you already have one it can
go there.  Place this file and the corresponding .bat file in that folder.
If it's some other folder, you'll have to edit the .bat file accordingly.
For linux, the files can be places usually in the user folder ~/.local/bin
to let it be in the path for the user. 

You can then run this in any folder by opening a command prompt
(Type "cmd" in the path bar and hit ENTER), then typing "hashme".
The default will be SHA256 to TXT format but if you want MD5 or SHA1 
just enter it as an argument (EX: hashme md5, hashme md5 tsv). The order
of the arguments does not matter.  

Valid hash formats are SHA256, MD5, SHA1
Valid output formats are txt, tsv, csv

Defaults are SHA256 and TXT but you can add the arguments directly to 
your starting batch or shell script to override these not not have to
enter them each time as arguments. 

Example Batch File:
   @echo off
   python c:\Scripts\hashme.py %*

Added override to default to md5 hash and tsv output format
   @echo off
   python c:\Scripts\hashme.py md5 tsv %*

The hasher will take the LAST hash and format given.
EX: hashme sha256 txt md5 will give the md5 hashes in txt format.

WINDOWS ONLY------------------------------------------------------------
For Windows ONLY with the automated reports program with the same author, 
the argument "hr" for Hash Reports can be used.  It will hash all .pdf
files in the same folder EXCEPT the FPR.pdf file.  It will display the 
output in a way it can be copied to the Windows clipboard AND displayed
in the output window in case you are working and use the clipboard after
it finishes but before entering it in the police report.  

You can use "cb" for clip board to hash ONE specified file and then
display the output on screen AND copy the file name and hash to the 
Windows clipboard. 

    EX: hashme myfile.bin md5 cb
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To add to the system path in Windows

Open the settings and search "variables".  Two items will come up. 
choose "Edit the system environment variables".  

Click the bottom button "Environment Variables" then use the BOTTOM
windows titled "System variables".

Select the "Path" and click "Edit". Now add the folder your scripts 
are in.  C:\scripts is suggested so you don't have to change the 
.bat file.

If it doesn't work, you may have to restart the machine for it to take
effect but it usually works without the restart.
